# Memory Marionette Model (m3)

## Overview

The Memory Marionette Model (m3) is a powerful verification library designed to expose subtle bugs in multicore memory subsystems. By implementing the Marionette Model methodology, m3 brings unmatched precision to memory operation tracking and validationâ€”making it an essential tool for anyone serious about building reliable multicore processors.

### Why use M3?
- Enable co-simulation of multicore systems running share memory programs
- Verify correct memory behavior in multicore systems
- Track and validate memory operation ordering
- Ensure memory consistency across cores
- Support both in-order and out-of-order execution models
- Provide comprehensive debugging and error detection capabilities

### Key Features
1. Marionette Model: Unlike traditional single-point "at commit" verification, m3 uses a marionette model that tracks operations throughout execution, enabling true co-simulation of multicore shared memory programs

2. Comprehensive Operation Tracking: Tracks loads, stores, and atomic operations from issue through completion, with support for store-to-load forwarding and store merging

3. Verification Mechanisms: Memory consistency checking, operation ordering validation, error detection and reporting, comprehensive state tracking

4. Flexible Integration: Support for multiple emulators (Dromajo, Spike), bridge-based architecture for easy extension, configurable verification parameters

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/texerai/m3.git
   cd m3
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake

   # macOS
   brew install cmake
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j
   ```

The library will be built as `libm3.a` in the `build` directory. Headers will be in `include/`.
